            -I'm a native Argentine, recently arrived in Santa Catarina in search of opportunities in the Technology sector, since I was a child I've been passionate about computers, so much so that at home they told me that when I was born I came with a keyboard and mouse, I've always organized myself to work with my knowledge , be it assembling and maintaining PCs for neighbors, friends, acquaintances or gaming venues or small businesses, my command of English is sufficient to spend a lot of time talking in writing or on video calls, but I have to work on my Portuguese, which for now it's basic.

            My experience is based on practices in a team of enthusiastic developers where we carry out development simulations within a company, with agile methodologies and each one committed to their role and the project. I have good knowledge in website building, structure and style.
